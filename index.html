            <article>
                <p>The hymnal we use to sing hymns in our churches employs Lutheran congregational singing, a genre of
                    music typically written for four mixed voices. It was Martin Luther who made an effort to spread the
                    news of the Reformation through singing in a universal language of the people, using well-known
                    popular melodies and incorporating religious texts (Doukhan, 2017).</p>
                <p>Not only did he revolutionize religion, but music also became a form of protest. Before 1517, the
                    Catholic Church held control over music throughout most of Europe, with laypeople not participating
                    and only listening to plainchants (single-voice chants) in Latin sung in choir (Valentino, 2017).
                    Chorales underwent rhythmic changes and syncopated patterns until reaching their current form
                    (Doukhan, 2017).</p>
                <p>The harmony found in four-voice hymns is:
                <ul>
                    <li>Originally composed of chords.</li>
                    <li>These chords are arranged or
                        placed in different voices to balance the sound and provide an aesthetic beauty.</li>
                    <li>Generally, the
                        soprano voice carries the melody</li>
                    <li> The other three voices accompany the melody, creating the sonic
                        equilibrium.</li>
                    <li>On occasions, more than four voices are used.</li>

                <p>A chord is a combination of three or more notes placed at a distance of a third interval in each
                    voice (Tchaikovsky et al., 2014).</p>
                <p>The triads primarily used in hymns are formed on each degree of the scale using only three notes. We
                    can use Roman numerals corresponding to the scale degrees to identify the chords, using uppercase
                    for major chords and lowercase for minors.</p>

                <p>Also, they can be identified by the chord's root name. The only disadvantage of using this chord
                    nomenclature is that it does not indicate the role it plays within the tonality. In this text, we'll
                    use both forms of nomenclature to illustrate the examples provided.</p>

                <img class="score01" src="images/003.jpg" alt="Name of Chords">
                <p>As chords are formed by two intervals of a third, they can create different combinations that result
                    in four different types of chords: major, minor, diminished, or augmented. It's useful to remember
                    that the smallest distance in the scale is the semitone, and a major third interval consists of four
                    semitones, while a minor third is equivalent to three semitones.</p>

            <header>Arrangement of a Triad</header>
            <article>
                <p>In choral writing, each voice should have its corresponding clef. However, to simplify and reduce
                    costs, it's written using two staves, employing the treble clef for female voices and the bass clef
                    for male voices.</p>
                <p>When using triads in a four-voice set, one voice is duplicated, preferably the root, and secondly,
                    the fifth of the chord is duplicated, avoiding the duplication of the third. Generally, the bass
                    sings the chord's root, but occasionally, for melodic beauty, ornamental notes like passing tones or
                    leaps are used. Hence, at times, the bass might sing the third or the fifth.</p>
                <p>The C chord in the following example can be written in different ways.</p>
                <p><code>Example of C chord in 4 voices</code></p>
                <img class="score01" src="images/005.jpg" alt="Example of C chord in 4 voices">
                <p>Sometimes, when the bass sings the fifth of the chord, there's an imbalance due to inversion. Even
                    when singing the third, this instability is usually noticed in the chords, yet they are used as
                    passing notes or chords or when the bass melody resolves to another chord.</p>

                <p>Four-note chords are constructed by adding a third to the fifth degree of a triad, and they're termed
                    as seventh chords.</p>
                <p>Chords to which the sixth degree is added to triads are called sixth chords. There are two types,

                <p>Each chord position serves a harmonic function, allowing for the naming of each chord according to
                    the degree. Transitioning from one chord to another generates different sensations, tonal function
                    can either be stable or create tension based on the harmonic context set by the composer in various
                    parts of the composition. The I degree fulfills the tonic function, the IV degree serves as the
                    subdominant, and the V degree is the dominant.</p>

                <p>The chord of the first degree is named the tonic chord because it serves as the tonal center, marking
                    a point of rest or the center of gravity. This chord provides stability and is present as both the
                    first and last chords in most hymns from the hymnal, with only a few exceptions.</p>
                <p>Its function as a point of rest is crucial in Western tonal music as it establishes a sense of
                    conclusion or resolution after different harmonic progressions.</p>

            <article>
                <p>This chord holds the value of the IV degree and creates a certain tension that leads to resolution
                    either towards a higher tension (to the dominant) or towards stability (returning to the tonic).
                    It's considered "subdominant" because it precedes the dominant chord, which is the V degree, acting
                    as an intermediate step between the tonic chord's stability and the tension generated by the
                    dominant chord.</p>

            <header>The Dominant Chord</header>
            <article>
                <p>This chord contains a tritone (three whole tones) built on the fifth note of the scale, generating
                    significant instability. Its function is to harmonically resolve towards a stable chord such as the
                    I or VI degree to create a sense of rest or tonal conclusion. The tension generated by the
                    fifth-degree chord is due to the presence of the minor seventh interval, occurring between the third
                    note of the fifth-degree chord and the seventh note of the scale. This seventh tends to resolve to
                    the scale's first note.</p>
                <p>With these three harmonic functions (tonic, dominant, and subdominant), most hymns can be accompanied
                    on the piano. Let's see an example applied in a hymn.</p>
                <p>The first step is to identify the chords in the hymn's harmony.</p>

            <header>The II Degree</header>
            <article>
                <p>The second degree is called the supertonic, constructed on the second note of the diatonic scale and
                    represented as a minor triad. In the key of C, it's composed of the notes D-F-A.</p>
                <p>Its main function is to add a bit more variety and harmonic movement. It doesn't possess the same
                    resolution strength as the tonic, subdominant, or dominant degrees, but it can be used to create
                    interesting harmonic progressions and moments of tension that eventually resolve.</p>
                <P>In some progressions, the supertonic can act as an intermediate step between the tonic and dominant,
                    providing a subtle tonal color change before reaching the dominant chord and finally the tonic
